So we've separated the cherenkov and scintillator total energy spectra. We can then make a direct analogy here to the beam energy, which is 20 GeV, and do some nice looking fits to make it look convincing.

Then we need to do the calibration still. We've got most of the coefficients done at a dumb level, along with a basic separation into muons and pions for the 80 GeV runs. What we need to do next is take a look at what the levelling of these are. Maybe for this we should make a histogram of the *averages*, rather than the entire spread. Either that, or the total ADC count for only the tower under the beamspot.

Should really equalise via this process:
  1. Find per-channel scintillator averages of muon data in 80GeV pion runs
  2. Determine equalisation coefficients with this data
  3. Apply these equalisation coefficients to muon data and pion data
